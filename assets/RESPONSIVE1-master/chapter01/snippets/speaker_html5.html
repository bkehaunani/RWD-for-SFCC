    <p>Craig has been a regular at Web Directions South since before it was Web Directions South. He’s moved from the audience, through moderation, and on to being a presenter.</p>
    <p>Along the way he’s released the second edition of his book with Earle Castledine, jQuery: Novice to Ninja, and has toured the East Coast capitals delivering <span class="caps">HTML5</span> workshops.

All the while he’s been working at some great companies, with even greater people.</p>
